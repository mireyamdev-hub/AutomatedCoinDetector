# AutomatedCoinDetector
Automated Coin Detector (Dart)

Create an app that once every 2 seconds creates randomly a String 'Real' or 'Fake'.
The widget wil be explandable so when expanded, it will show the timestamp when String is added into the List.
If the word is 'Real', it will make a sound meaning the coin is Real.
(Sound and animation are not implemented)

Here it is a capture of the project:
